	<p> Ermmm Hi, I've been wondering if you want some sort of space. I would understand that but honestly, I don't think I'd be saying yes if you ask me something like that.
	Yes. I am that selfish. I used to want it for both of us as well, but space is the last thing I'd want for both of us. I don't want to be distant. 
	And if things get too uncomfortable and you start slowly pushing me away, I'll get closer faster than you pushing me away. Ion really care how long it takes for you to 
	get used to this kind of relationship. I'll be patient like I always said. Even if you can't accept that, then knowing it is enough. When have I ever lied about what I do? dba. 
	
	We've grown so much closer. I still remember those awkward conversations during the first 2 weeks. Remember when we weren't even that close yet, I was pissing u off already?
	that was your sign that I was gonna be like that for as long as youre with me. Remember the eye contacts we had in early 2nd quarter? Where we'd look away once we sync 
	our eye contact timing. Nowadays, we laugh at what we say to one another and always so makulit with each other. It's hard to say what goes on in my mind when we do that.
	Saying let's be together forever sounds cliche, too early, and overall too naive. But I don't care, because that's exactly what I want. We don't always have to do things together.
	We are our own individuals and are still learning and growing. Whenever you start to run away from everyone even me, looking at the wall, looking down at your shadow, know I'm still there,
	by your side. And don't forget it. I'll be the reason why your "spark" still glows even when things around you get dark. I hope you are too. Then when my own mind starts to bring me down,
	remind me that I'm not alone either. And I don't have to do things alone anymore. Remind me loud and clear. I appreciated small things around the places I usually go to even more because of you. 
	If I tried to say this in person, all this, words would just disappear and I'd stutter a lot. I want to listen to your heartbeat, Bal. Because I know your heart wants to say it to me when your mouth can't utter and your fingers can't type it.
	You may have avoided me, scratched me twice, made me bleed a little once, and in your thoughts treated me "unfairly", you probably think I'm starting to hate you or even a bit of anger is growing in my heart.
	But I like you more than you think. It's really hard to hate you. If you think you're hurting me or it's unhealthy that I'm doing all this for you when you can't show half of it,
	Like what Miyamura from horimiya said, I'm sorry that I like you. I like you too much for my own good and that's why I'm gonna stay and not give space at all. I'm not going anywhere.
	I'll only ever go away if you tell me to go away and you are sure and confident to say those kinds of words.
